🧠 Customer CSAT Prediction Using Deep Learning
This project applies deep learning techniques to predict Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) from review text data provided by Shopzilla. By processing customer reviews and applying Natural Language Processing (NLP), the model classifies feedback as either positive or negative, offering insights into customer sentiment.

🔍 Overview
Customer satisfaction is crucial for businesses aiming to retain users and improve services. In this project, we build a text classification pipeline using deep learning to:

Preprocess and vectorize textual data.

Train a neural network model on labeled CSAT data.

Predict customer sentiment from unseen reviews.

🧾 Dataset
Source: Shopzilla Customer Feedback Dataset (CSAT data)

Contents: Customer reviews labeled as satisfied (1) or unsatisfied (0)
